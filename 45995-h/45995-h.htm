<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> beautiful island of Porto Rico lies, as
you will see by looking at the map, near
that great open doorway to North America
and the United States which we call the Gulf
of Mexico. Very near it looks, does it not?</p>

<p>So the little cousin with whom we are going
to become acquainted to-day is our near neighbour
as well. To be sure, a schoolboy or girl
from Massachusetts would have to travel a
thousand miles or so to see his Porto Rican
cousin; and even a child from Florida
could not say good morning to his Porto
Rican neighbour unless he were to take a sail
of several hundred miles.</p>

<p>However, we, who are used to taking little
excursions over the world (between the covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of a book), so that we may learn to know our
tiny Eskimo cousins who live near the icy
pole, and our little African cousins south of
the equator, as well as our Japanese cousins
on the other side of the globe, think
nothing of the distance between here and
Porto Rico. We should expect to feel very
much at home after we arrived there, especially
now that Porto Rico has become part of
our own country.</p>

<p>We shall find our Porto Rican cousins and
neighbours, with their dark skins, black hair,
and soft black eyes, somewhat different in appearance,
indeed, from ourselves; and we
shall not be able to understand what they say
unless we have learned the Spanish language;
for, as we know, the parents or forefathers of
our Porto Rican cousins came from Spain to
Porto Rico, just as the parents and forefathers
of most of us who speak English came from
England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>However, these are slight differences; and
the Spanish people, from whom our black-eyed
Porto Rican cousin is descended, belong
to the same branch of the great human family
as we do, who are descended, most of us, from
English people. That is, the Spanish people
and their descendants, the Porto Ricans, belong
to the white race. Manuel is thus a
nearer relative than the little black cousin,
who belongs to the negro race; or the little
Japanese cousin, who belongs to the yellow
or Mongolian race; or the little Indian
cousin, who belongs to the red race; or the
little Malayan cousin, who belongs to the
brown race. So we shall welcome the Porto
Rican neighbours near our doorway into our
nation's family. They were already our cousins
by descent; they have become our adopted
brothers in our nation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>MANUEL.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a beautiful May day. The air is still,
yet clear; the sun is shining brightly, but it is
not too warm for comfort. There is not a
cloud in the sky.</p>

<p>And yet lazy little Manuel lies curled up
in his comfortable bed, sound asleep at eight
o'clock in the morning. See! A smile lights
up his face. Perhaps he is dreaming of his
newly adopted American brothers.</p>

<p>Of the things he has read about, he longs
to see a real New England snow-storm most
of all. To built a snow fort, to make balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of snow and have a mock battle, what fun it
must be! To slide down the icy hills, to ride
over the snowy roads to the jingle of the
sleigh-bells,&mdash;surely there is nothing in his
island home to equal sport like that. And
so in his dreams our little Manuel takes part
in games he cannot play while awake, until
they at last become quite real to him.</p>

<p>But now the door opens, and old black
Juana, Manuel's nurse ever since he was born,
comes softly into the dark room, bringing a
tray in her hand. She steps toward a little
stand beside the bed, and sets down the tray.
Then she goes to the casement and opens
wide the wooden shutter. The sunlight pours
into the room, and Manuel slowly opens his
big black eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is you, mammy dear, is it?" he
says, sleepily, and slowly stretches himself and
sits up in bed.</p>

<p>Juana brings a basin of fresh water and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
towel for the boy to bathe his hands and face,
then draws the stand closer to his side and
hands him a cup of steaming chocolate and a
roll. What thick, rich chocolate it is, and
what a dainty little roll! This is all the boy
ever cares to eat in the morning, for he is
seldom hungry when first roused. His father
and mother are having coffee in their own
bedroom at the same time Manuel is drinking
his chocolate. This is the way every one in
the family takes the first meal of the day.</p>

<p>Manuel is a creole. Many, many years
ago his great-great-great (indeed I cannot tell
you how many times great) grandfather left
Spain and crossed the wide Atlantic Ocean.
He came to this beautiful island of Porto
Rico to live, and his children and grandchildren
liked the place so well they never cared
to go back to the mother country. Such
people are called creoles; that is, people
born in the West Indies of European parents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
They set out great plantations of tobacco and
sugar and became very rich.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i019.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="two children by fountain" />
<div class="caption">"A FOUNTAIN IS PLAYING IN THE CENTRE OF THE PAVED YARD"</div>
</div>

<p>Manuel's father has many acres of their
land still, but the fortune of the family has
been slowly lost; and, although there are
many servants, and a large, comfortable home,
there is not much money to spend.</p>

<p>The house is at least a hundred years old.
It is made of blocks of stone, built around
the four sides of a square courtyard, where
orange-trees and magnolias stand in immense
pots. A fountain is playing in the centre of
the paved yard and making soft music as the
spray falls upon the stones. There is a large
aquarium at one side, where Manuel's mother
cares for many beautiful fishes.</p>

<p>Vines climb up over the wide verandas;
the stone work is nearly hidden by mosses
which have made their home here; and, over
all, the tall, graceful trees of the tropics sway
gently to and fro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>There are water-lemon and banana, cocoanut
and tamarind trees growing close to the house,
and underneath in the rose-bushes and acacias
hundreds of brilliant humming-birds are glancing
in and out.</p>

<p>At first thought, it may seem strange to us
that there are no windows fitted with glass in
this old mansion. Our window is an opening
in the wall of a building to let in or keep out
light and air, as needed. In Porto Rico, where
it is summer all the time, people need to have
all the air possible in the house; they have no
use for panes of glass such as we use. These
are rarely seen anywhere in the island, but
instead of them bars of iron are fastened across
the casements, or else there are wooden shutters,
as in Manuel's home. The slats of these
shutters can be set open as much as one likes,
or closed tightly when the heavy rains come.</p>

<p>When Manuel has finished drinking his
chocolate, old Juana prepares a bath for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
She does not bring any soap, for his mother
believes it spoils the skin; but the bath is
scented with Florida-water, and the sweet
perfume fills the room.</p>

<p>Manuel is soon dressed, for he wears only
a little shirt and loose white trousers during
the daytime at home. His feet are left bare,
so he may be as cool as possible.</p>

<p>What a handsome fellow he is now that he
is wide awake! He is a little smaller than his
American brothers of his own age, but he is
well-shaped and graceful. People say he looks
very much like his beautiful mother. His
black eyes are tender and loving, his hair is
black, but fine and soft; his skin is dark, yet
clear; and his teeth are even and white. Yes,
he is not only good-looking, but kind and
lovable, we feel sure.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>DOLORES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now he goes from his room out into
the courtyard, for the house is only one story
high. His sister Dolores is there already, and
runs to kiss him good morning.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dolores," says Manuel, "do you
think we have time before our lessons begin
to go over to Salvador's and see if he got those
fireflies yet? He was to bring them to me
last night."</p>

<p>"It's only nine o'clock now, we have an
hour yet," answers Dolores, in her sweet
voice. "I'm all ready, so let's go."</p>

<p>Both children put on their broad white
hats and take a shady path through the fields.
They soon reach the huts of the coloured
workmen, clustered together in a grove of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
pimento-trees. A "pimento-walk" such a
grove is sometimes called, and it would be
hard to find anything more beautiful. The
trees are of nearly the same height, reaching
up about thirty feet from the ground. The
branches are covered with glossy green leaves.
The berries are not yet ready to pick, but
when they are still green the coloured boys on
the place must climb the trees and break off
the twigs; they will throw them down to their
sisters on the ground, who will pick off the
berries and store them in bags for their master
to send to the United States mainland. We
call these berries "allspice," and after they
have been dried we buy them under that name.</p>

<p>The huts of the workmen are scarcely more
than sheds with roofs of thatched palm leaves.
Some have sides and doorways, while others
are quite open. What do these poor people
care for that in this land of summer? If they
have plantains enough to satisfy their hunger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
plenty of cigars to smoke, and hammocks of
the bark of the palm-tree to swing in, they
are happy and contented.</p>

<p>Within the huts one can see a few earthen
pots and gourds; that is all that is needed in
their simple housekeeping, whether they belong
to the black race or are "jibaros," as the
poor whites are called. And most of the
people are poor in this beautiful land, although
Mother Nature is so generous here in her gifts
to men.</p>

<p>But we must go back to Manuel and
Dolores, who are quickly surrounded by a
group of little children. They are of all
colours: some black as jet, the whites of
their eyes looking like windows; others of
shades running from dark brown to pale yellow.
But they are all noisy, all happy, all talking
at the same time, and all naked.</p>

<p>As for Dolores, herself, the dainty little
maiden wears only a cotton slip at her play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Many another white child on the island goes
about her home with no clothing, and feels
very comfortable, too. It is only when the
children get to be nine or ten years old that
their parents make them dress; and that is a
sad time for them, you may be sure.</p>

<p>But Dolores lives in quite a grand way, you
know, so she and Manuel were never allowed
to go about naked since they were old enough
to walk.</p>

<p>But look! one of the little black boys is
handing something to Manuel. It is a net filled
with the fireflies or beetles he wished to get.</p>

<p>"Come to the house to-night, Salvador,"
says Manuel, as he takes his treasures, "and
I will pay you."</p>

<p>Now what do you suppose Manuel cares for
these beetles? They are not beautiful in the
daytime. We would far rather watch those
lovely green and blue butterflies flitting among
the bushes. But Manuel is going to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
pets of them. He will put them in a little
wicker cage, feed them with sugar, and they
will grow quite tame. At night they will be
more beautiful than any precious gems owned
by his mother.</p>

<p>Let us examine them. They are of a
dull drab colour, except around the eyes and
underneath, where there are rings or bands
that glow brightly in the dark, giving forth red
and green lights. They gleam like diamonds.
Manuel can read by their light, should he
choose to do so. The fireflies of Porto Rico
are the largest and most brilliant in the whole
world.</p>

<p>After the children have finished their lessons
to-day, perhaps they will take some calabashes
and bore holes in them. Then when night
comes they can put the beetles inside and
play outdoors with them for lanterns. Some
of the poor people in Porto Rico use no other
light at night, except these little creatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Manuel carries the net very carefully as he
and his sister return to the house. He does
not wish a single beetle to be injured or
frightened.</p>

<p>"Mamma dear!" he calls as he sees his
mother on the veranda, "you shall wear the
most beautiful one I have in your lace dress
to-night."</p>

<p>What a strange idea this seems to us! but
the smiling lady in her white wrapper does not
seem at all surprised. She often fastens the
living gems under the thin net of her evening
gown; perhaps they will glisten on her shoulders,
perhaps at her throat, or in her hair.
She certainly could not wear more beautiful
jewels than these.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my precious child," she
answers, "you are very thoughtful; but now
your teacher is waiting for you in the schoolroom.
Go to her, and give your studies good
attention this morning."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>LESSONS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dolores</span> and Manuel are soon busy with
their lessons. Although Manuel is twelve
years old and his sister ten, they are both
learning to speak French and a little Italian.
I fear you would think them rather backward
in arithmetic and other grammar-school studies,
but their parents do not see the need
of knowing as much of such things as do
American fathers and mothers.</p>

<p>The children have always had a governess,
and have never been in a public schoolroom
in their lives. In fact, these are only now
becoming common since our people have taken
Porto Rico under their care. Think of it,
children! In this beautiful island, only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
person out of five can read and write at present.
Most of these have been brought up in
the towns and cities. Those who live out
in the country seldom have had a chance to
go to school. If they were too poor to hire
a governess or study with the nuns in the
convents, they grew up ignorant indeed.</p>

<p>Dolores is taught to embroider and to play
a little on the guitar, so her mother thinks her
daughter is quite accomplished. Besides, both
Manuel and his sister are very graceful dancers
and can sing well. These are quite
important studies, for wherever one goes in
Porto Rico, there he will find music and
dancing.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven the books are closed,
and the children join their parents for the first
regular meal of the day. This is the real
breakfast.</p>

<p>It is served in the large, low dining-room,
where for the first time we see the children's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
grown-up sister, Teresa. She is a lovely
young lady of sixteen, slight and graceful.
She has the same black eyes as Manuel and
Dolores, soft and beautiful.</p>

<p>She wears no stockings, but her feet are
encased in dainty blue kid slippers. They
are embroidered with pearl beads, and, no
doubt, came from Paris.</p>

<p>An ugly-looking woman takes her place
beside Teresa at the table. This is her
"duenna." It is her duty to go everywhere
with the young girl. It would not be considered
at all proper for Teresa to go driving, or
even walking, alone. It would not do for her
to go shopping to the town only three miles
away unless her duenna were with her; and as
for a party or any evening entertainment whatever,
if Teresa were to go without her parents
or this same duenna, every one in the country
around would be terribly shocked.</p>

<p>But now all are busy eating the breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the coloured waiter is serving. First, there is
a nice omelet, cooked in olive oil. Then
come pineapple jam, fish fried a delicate
brown, fried bananas, fried chicken, and a
salad made of many kinds of vegetables. We
must not forget to mention the apricots stewed
in honey, nor the tea steeped with the leaves
of lemon verbena. It has a delicious odour,
and Manuel's father and mother are very fond
of it.</p>

<p>There is no butter to eat on the rolls, but
the fact is, almost all the butter in Porto Rico
comes in tin cans from other countries. On
account of the hot climate, it is often rancid,
so it is seldom used in Manuel's home. The
cooking is done with olive oil. Nearly everything
is fried, instead of being broiled or
roasted, and no one feels the need of butter.</p>

<p>Manuel and Dolores, like some other boys
and girls we know, are very fond of sweet
things, so they eat a great deal of the cooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
fruits on the table. But they also seem to
like the salad very much, even though it is
so hot with Cayenne pepper as to burn the
mouth of any one not used to it. But the
children are accustomed to highly spiced
dishes. Our cooking would seem tasteless
to them. Perhaps it is the hot climate all
the year round that makes it necessary to
have strongly flavoured foods to excite the
appetite.</p>

<p>After this second breakfast is over, cigarettes
are served, and, would you believe it!
our little Manuel, as well as his mother and
older sister, joins in a smoke. Such is the
custom of his country that even children of
three or four years use tobacco. It is no
wonder, then, that as the boys and girls grow
up, they have so little strength. We are no
longer surprised that Manuel does not care
much for active play.</p>

<p>It is now the hottest part of the day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
boy and his sister play a few games of dominoes
and cards out on the veranda, and then
sleepily stretch themselves in hammocks under
the palms for an afternoon nap. Manuel's
little dog, Ponce, lies on the ground by his
side, ready to bark if any stranger should
come near his master.</p>

<p>But what do the poor children of Porto
Rico do, while Manuel is taking his "siesta,"
as the afternoon nap is called? They, too,
are probably having their siestas, for all classes
of people rest during the hottest part of the
day. Very little business is done in the cities;
the time for work is in the early morning and
late afternoon.</p>

<p>The coloured children of the plantation
would think it a perfect feast to have a breakfast
like Manuel's. A bit of salt fish, with
some breadfruit, plantains, and coffee,&mdash;these
satisfy their hunger day after day. But in the
sugar season, when the canes are ripe and full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of juice, then indeed it is hard to make the
people work, whether they are white or black.
Oh, the delicious sugar-cane! there is nothing
like the pleasure of sucking it. Here and
there, in every nook and corner, one sees boys
and girls, men and women, with joints of the
cane in their hands, sucking away for dear life.
Then is the time to stop all worry and grow
fat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THROUGH THE WOODS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Manuel and Dolores finish their
siesta, it is nearly three o'clock. Old Juana
appears on the veranda with a pitcher of limeade,
made with fresh limes, and Manuel drinks
glass after glass. It is very refreshing, and he
begins to feel like moving about, so he orders
his pet donkey to be brought. He says to
Dolores:</p>

<p>"I think I will ride through the woods and
around the plantation. I will take my gun, as
we may see some rabbits. Please come with
me, Dolores."</p>

<p>The little girl is always ready to oblige her
brother, so she sends for her own donkey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the children start for the woods, with Ponce
following close behind.</p>

<p>Dear little patient, long-eared donkeys!
Just as slow and stupid and stubborn as other
donkeys in other parts of the world. Manuel
loves his Pedro, as he is called. Pedro has
been his friend and companion ever since the
boy was big enough to sit up straight.</p>

<p>Pedro is not obliged to work very hard, and
is now quite willing to set off on a gentle
trot.</p>

<p>Dolores holds a dainty little parasol over
her head, but as they reach the deep shadow
of the woods, she shuts it down; then in some
magical way changes it into a fan, with which
she brushes away the mosquitoes.</p>

<p>What beautiful woods these are! Cocoanut,
banana, sago, and palmetto trees grow here, as
well as cedar, India-rubber, guava, and many
other tall and stately trees belonging to the
tropics. More than five hundred different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
kinds of trees are found on the one island of
Porto Rico, every one of them growing over
fifteen feet high.</p>

<p>Just think of it, children! Manuel can
pick lemons, oranges, bananas, limes, plantains,
peaches, apricots, olives, tamarinds, and&mdash;dear
me! I can't tell you how many other
fruits, without stepping off the land owned by
his father.</p>

<p>"Listen!" says Dolores to her brother,
"don't you hear that grinding, buzzing noise?
It sounds like some one grinding a knife. I
wonder what it can be."</p>

<p>The children make the donkeys stop, and
look all around them. No one is to be
seen. Then turning their eyes up into the
branches of a tree close by, they see a strange
sight. It is a beetle at least six inches long.
He is very busy sawing off a small branch.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what that is," says Manuel.
"Father has told me all about him. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
people call him a razor-grinder because he
makes a noise like the grinding of a razor.
He is the largest beetle in the world. So
come along, Dolores, I want to shoot some
pigeons."</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid, Manuel, to go any
farther into the woods?" whispers his sister.
"I just heard a queer, rustling noise. Perhaps
it is a wild dog. It may spring at us before
we can get away."</p>

<p>The children of Porto Rico have more fear
of wild dogs than of anything else. They
imagine all kinds of terrible things about
them, and whenever they come to a dark
place in the woods, they begin to fear an
attack. The fact is that dogs, as well as cats,
often leave their homes and run wild on account
of the good times they can have in the
woods. There are so many mice and birds to
be caught that they need never go hungry,
but there is little to fear from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>That is what Manuel thinks, sensible little
fellow that he is, so he answers:</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, Dolores, you never yet saw
a wild dog in your life. So come along; I'll
take care of you. You know I have my
gun."</p>

<p>Just at this moment Manuel spies a brown
object behind a rock. Look! now a sharp-pointed
nose is thrust straight up in the air,
and a pair of bright eyes can be seen.</p>

<p>"That is a dear little agouti. Please don't
shoot him. See how shy he looks; he is too
scared to run. Oh, what a beautiful glossy
coat he has!" says Dolores. "I wish we had
one to tame for a pet. Don't you, Manuel?"</p>

<p>At first thought, Manuel was going to
shoot the agouti, but he quickly thinks better
of it. Any one would indeed be hard-hearted
to wish to kill such a pretty, timid little creature.
The agouti is a cousin of the hare and
the rabbit, but lives in warmer lands than they.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The children ride slowly along. Manuel
shoots a couple of pigeons, and they are about
to turn out of the woods when they spy a big
hole in the ground near them. The appearance
of the earth shows that it must have
been freshly dug.</p>

<p>"I know what that means," exclaims Manuel,
"an armadillo is hiding from us. He
heard us coming and at once burrowed under
ground. I don't see how they can dig so
fast. Do you? Now let's make our donkeys
rest, and see if he will come out when all is
quiet."</p>

<p>The children get off and tie their donkeys
to some trees, while they themselves sit down
at quite a little distance from the hole.</p>

<p>It is not long before Mr. Armadillo appears,
reaching his head out from his shell as he
climbs. He does not come very far, however,
before Ponce spies him. The dog begins to
bark furiously, and tries to get away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Manuel, who holds him by his collar. The
armadillo flees back into his hole "as quick as
a flash," as the saying is, and does not make
his appearance again, although the children
wait quite a while longer.</p>

<p>What a curious looking animal it is, with its
shell of horny plates, and a white horn on its
back through which it blows and makes a loud
noise! When in danger, it draws itself completely
within its shell. The flesh is a great
dainty, but the little animal is hard to catch.
The negroes on some of the West Indian
islands belonging to England call the armadillo
"hog-in-armour." Not a bad name,
is it?</p>

<p>Manuel and Dolores, still mounted on their
patient little donkeys, leave the woods, and
come out upon a path leading through their
father's coffee plantation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>THE COFFEE-TREE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the first white people came to Porto
Rico they did not find any coffee among the
other tropical fruits. To-day it is the most
valuable product of the island, yet all the trees
growing now came from a few plants brought
here nearly two hundred years ago. Perhaps
you would like to hear the story.</p>

<p>In the year 1714, all the coffee used in the
civilised world was under the control of the
Dutch. They were very jealous of other
people growing it, but one of the governors
of Amsterdam gave a single plant to the King
of France. From this plant a few others were
raised and sent across the ocean to Martinique,
an island of the West Indies belonging to
France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The voyage was long. The fresh water on
board the ship nearly gave out, but the man
who had the plants in his care shared his
allowance with them. They were thus kept
alive, and from them have come the coffee-trees
that cover thousands of acres of land
to-day in Porto Rico, Martinique, and the
other islands.</p>

<p>Manuel and Dolores delight in riding
through the plantation at this season of the
year; the rows of small, evenly trimmed trees,
with their glossy green leaves, are always a
pretty sight. But just now they are more
beautiful than at other times, for each tree is
a mass of snow-white blossoms, filling the air
with their fragrance.</p>

<p>Dolores's mother hires some of the coloured
children to collect petals of the coffee flowers
as they drop upon the ground. She will fill
jars with them to scent her drawing-room with
their perfume; but no one is allowed to pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the blossoms from the trees, for each flower
means a berry later on in the season.</p>

<p>As the fruit forms, it is first green, then
a pale pink, and at last a bright red. Not
all the berries ripen at the same time, as
cherries do, so the autumn picking lasts several
weeks.</p>

<p>After they have been gathered, the berries
are first washed and then hulled by machinery.
Even then, however, they are not ready for
market, for they must still be dried. At Manuel's
home this is done by spreading them
on floors paved with stones, where the sun
can shine upon them; but on larger plantations
it is usually done by steam or hot
air.</p>

<p>The men and women who work for Manuel's
father are always busy, for there are
many things to do besides attending to the
coffee-trees. These stand in rows about fifteen
feet apart, and between the rows there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
"catch crops," as they are called. One can
see sweet potatoes, pigeon pease, eddoes, and
other vegetables.</p>

<p>Coffee-trees are quite tender, and need a
good deal of shade when they are young, so
banana and plantain trees have been planted
between the rows to protect them from the
hot sun.</p>

<p>Manuel's father does not pay his workmen
in money; he gives them a certain number of
plantains for each day's labour. They keep
enough of this fruit to feed their families, and
sell the rest in the towns near by.</p>

<p>The children stop for a chat with the overseer,
then ride onward to the house, for dinner
must be ready.</p>

<p>Just as the meal is over, and the family
leave the dining-room, the convent bells begin
to ring. It is six o'clock, the time for evening
prayer, and all bow their heads in silence.
Although Manuel is a little boy, he likes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
these quiet moments in the day. The air
is filled with peace; it seems as though he
feels God's love more fully than at any other
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>SONGS AND STORIES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Night</span> falls suddenly on this beautiful
home. There is no long twilight as in northern
lands; and soon the stars are shining,
myriads of them. They do not twinkle, but
give a strong, steady light.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="348" height="500" alt="a family by huts" />
<div class="caption">"THE HOMES OF THE WORKMEN"</div>
</div>

<p>This is the best part of the day. The
planter sits on the veranda, smoking; his
wife, in her delicate evening dress, keeps him
company. Teresa plays some sweet tunes on
her guitar and sings, while her duenna sits
back in a rattan chair and dozes. Manuel
and Dolores dance together along the garden
paths or play with their fireflies.</p>

<p>Hark! listen to that lively music coming
from the homes of the workmen. We know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
there are mandolins among the instruments
they are playing, but what is that strange,
swishing noise we hear, keeping time with the
other instruments? It is somewhat like the
sound of shuffling feet. It is made upon
gourds notched in many places, with holes
in the shape of triangles cut in the necks.</p>

<p>A few nights ago Manuel and Dolores
begged their father to take them over to the
"quarters," as the cabins of the coloured farm
labourers are called. Manuel said:</p>

<p>"We want to see the sport. They have
such good times over there when their work is
done, and do tell such funny stories. But,
after all, papa, it's the way they tell them that
I like best. Their black eyes are so solemn
and look as though they believed every word
that is said."</p>

<p>When the planter and his children drew
near, they found the coloured people squatting
in a big circle in front of one of the huts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
The sun was just setting in a great round ball
in the west. There was still light enough in
the sky to show the shining dark faces ranged
around. Two rows of glistening ivory teeth
could be plainly seen in each face as the workmen
jumped up to bow and smile before
"Massa, little Massa, and little Missus."
They were quite proud to be honoured by a
visit from these great people. And now the
sun suddenly dropped below the horizon, and
the air seemed filled with the darkness.</p>

<p>It was the sign to begin, and the blacks, at
a motion from their leader, started in with an
old, old song not learned from books; it had
been handed down from the time when their
people lived in their native land of Africa. It
was a song about a beautiful star, and before it
was ended Dolores and Manuel felt as if the
star itself were a living friend and helper of
these ignorant, earnest people.</p>

<p>Sing! The word does not begin to describe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the music they not only heard but saw and
felt. The voices of the singers were sweet
and rich; their bodies swayed back and forth,
keeping perfect time. Their great round eyes
rolled from side to side, and as they sang verse
after verse, they seemed to forget their company
as well as themselves. Their faces shone
with a smile of perfect happiness.</p>

<p>When the song was ended a story was called
for, and an old gray-haired man began to tell
this tale of the elephant and the whale.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time an elephant was walking
on the shore. He saw a whale in the
water. He spoke to the whale and said:</p>

<p>"'Brother Whale, I can pull you up on to
the shore.'</p>

<p>"'Indeed you can't,' cried the whale.</p>

<p>"'I bet three thousand dollars that I can,'
the elephant answered.</p>

<p>"'All right, let me see you try,' the whale
said, quickly, and went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Soon afterward they met again. The
whale spoke this time, and said:</p>

<p>"'Brother Elephant, I can pull you into
the sea.'</p>

<p>"'What an idea!' said the elephant. 'No
man in the world could pull me into the sea.'</p>

<p>"Brother Rabbit heard the two talking, and
said:</p>

<p>"'I'll try it to-morrow at twelve o'clock.'</p>

<p>"He went away and got a piece of rope.
He tied one end of it around the whale's neck
and the other around the elephant's neck.
Then he said:</p>

<p>"'When I speak the word you must both
pull hard.'</p>

<p>"Now when the whale pulled, he dragged
the elephant into the sea. He said:</p>

<p>"'You, Brother Elephant, think the little
rabbit is doing all this.'</p>

<p>"Then the elephant pulled hard, and
brought the whale into the surf. The whale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
caught underneath a shelf of rock and the
elephant found himself fastened to a big tree.</p>

<p>"These two mightiest of creatures pulled
and pulled, till at last the rope broke, and the
elephant was jerked way back into the forest
and the whale was jerked way out to sea.
That is why you always see the whale in the
ocean and the elephant in the woods."</p>

<p>There was a great clapping of hands when
the tale was ended. After that, there were
other songs and stories, while the faces of the
people grew more earnest and eager after each
one.</p>

<p>It was growing late, and Manuel's father
said:</p>

<p>"Come, children, we must go now. Your
mother will be watching for you. It is long
past your bedtime."</p>

<p>As they walked homeward, Manuel was
quiet for some time. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Father, what nonsense many of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
stories are! Yet I like them, too, because
they seem to bring one so near all living
things. Even the rabbit and the elephant are
brothers to them. It's a little odd, though,
that in their animal stories they always make
the rabbit the wisest."</p>

<p>Sometimes Manuel's father walks over to
the "quarters" with his boy to see the dancing.
It is wild and exciting; it fairly makes
Manuel dizzy to watch the people twist and
turn themselves about. It is so different from
the slow, graceful steps he and Dolores have
been taught.</p>

<p>One wonders if the children are not afraid
of snakes in the long grass at night. No, for
in all Porto Rico, it is said, a poisonous serpent
has never been seen. In two other islands
of the West Indies the most deadly
snake of the Western world is found. This is
the terrible fer-de-lance whose bite is so much
dreaded; but this serpent has never made its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
way into Porto Rico. It probably drifted on
limbs of forest trees from South America to
the other islands, but never reached Manuel's
home. The boy should be very grateful that
it did not.</p>

<p>But there are other things for him to fear.
When he goes to bed to-night, he will get
Juana to look under his bed and in every
corner of the room before he can settle himself
to sleep. Is he afraid of burglars, do you
suppose? He never thinks of them; but he
knows that scorpions and centipedes can creep
into the house, and even into his bed, without
being seen. And oh! their sting means very
great suffering. Manuel's mother was once
stung by a scorpion's fiery tail, and the wound
was very painful for a long time.</p>

<p>It was only a few nights ago that Juana
found a centipede snuggled away under a
cushion in the sitting-room. Suppose some
one had sat down upon it unawares and been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
bitten! It makes the shivers creep up and
down Manuel's back to think of it.</p>

<p>The word centipede, perhaps you know,
means hundred-footed. These little insects
travel quite rapidly, and although they do not
cause death, they may make very painful
wounds.</p>

<p>There are other things, too, to trouble
Manuel and Dolores, for mosquitoes and fleas
are always plentiful, and sometimes the children
are awakened at night by an attack from
a small regiment of cruel little ants, and sleep
no more till morning.</p>

<p>There is a certain insect in the West Indies
known as a "chico," "chigoe," or "jigger,"
and woe to the toes of the person whom it
visits. It gets under the skin, and there lays
many eggs and prepares to make itself very
much at home. So if any person's toe begins
to itch, he needs to have it examined at once,
or there may be trouble. People have sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
been obliged to have the toe, and even
the foot and leg, cut off on account of the inflammation
caused by a chico and her family.</p>

<p>But the curious thing about it is that this
insect seems to prefer the toes of white strangers,
so that Manuel and Dolores, who were born
on the island, are pretty safe in going barefooted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>A CRUEL SPORT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To-morrow</span> there will be "lots of fun," as
Manuel says. After the morning service in
the church (for it will be Sunday) his father will
take him and Dolores to a cock-fight. Manuel
has been brought up to think there is no
pleasure like it.</p>

<p>When our government took charge of the
island, after the war with Spain, they forbade
any more cock-fighting. But all the people,
black and white, loved the sport so dearly, and
felt so bad on account of the new law, that it
has been set aside for the present.</p>

<p>Yes, Manuel, our gentle, kind-hearted little
cousin, has seen many cock-fights. Sunday is
the day his people take for the cruel pleasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
The boy's father has a very handsome cock
he has been training for to-morrow's fight.
He has bet quite a large sum on him, and is
even more anxious than his little son for the
next day to come. Why, this game-cock of
his has been getting as much care and attention
as a fine horse or pony generally receives
from a loving master!</p>

<p>And now it is Sunday. Not even a flea has
disturbed Manuel's dreams all night. Late in
the afternoon a carriage comes to the door, and
the planter drives away to the town with his
two younger children. His wife and Teresa
do not go, as it is not considered proper; but
it is thought to be all right for Manuel and
Dolores, as it is the fashion of this country for
boys and little girls to go.</p>

<p>What a crowd there is around the entrance!
Men and children, both black and white, are
jostling each other, talking loudly, and quarrelling
together. See that man elbow his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
along! He has a cock under his arm, probably
a contribution to the entertainment.</p>

<p>Manuel's father beckons to a servant who
has followed him on horseback with his precious
game-cock in charge, and together they
pass inside. Every one must pay for admission
to the show. And what does one see
within? There is a large cleared space covered
with sawdust. This is for the cocks; all
around are seats for the people who look
on.</p>

<p>Over at one side of the pit a man is lifting
the cocks, one by one, and weighing them to
find their fighting weight. See the care with
which each skinny fowl is tied in a bandanna
and handled; one would think it something
very precious. And, indeed, they are
precious, and cost their owners many dollars.</p>

<p>Look! the men are fastening sharp knives
to the spurs of the poor fowls, whose necks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and backs are bare of feathers. These knives
are sharper than the natural spurs, and will
help to make the battle a deadly one. They
are not always used, however.</p>

<p>And now, in the midst of shouts and yells,
the first battle begins. It means death to one
or both of the birds. The two cocks enter
into the fight as though they delight in it.
See the feathers fly from their heads and
sides!</p>

<p>Ah! one of them is blinded by the dust.
His owner rushes up and squirts alum water
in his eyes. The fight goes on till one cock
lies breathing his last on the ground, and the
other stands beside him dizzy and tottering,
yet hanging to him still.</p>

<p>There is silence while the bets are paid;
then the noise begins again, and two more
cocks are brought in. Battle after battle is
fought till night falls upon the cruel
sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that these game-cocks
enjoy fighting, yet this is no reason they
should be pitted against each other by human
beings; nor that people should think it sport
to watch suffering and bloodshed even among
stupid fowls.</p>

<p>It is hoped that Manuel and Dolores will
learn better as they grow older. We cannot
blame them now, for the customs of their
country have made it seem quite right and
proper.</p>

<p>A still more cruel sport was brought by the
Spaniards to Porto Rico, but it is now forbidden
by American law. This is bull-fighting.
It is not long, however, since the finest ladies
in the land dressed themselves in their handsomest
gowns, and with their husbands attended
a bull-fight. You would have thought
to see the rich jewels and fans, the fine silks
and satins, that they were in a ballroom.</p>

<p>Do not let us think of such sad things any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
longer, however. Those days are gone by
for ever, let us hope.</p>

<p>While Manuel and Dolores are giving their
mother an exciting account of the Sunday's
pleasure, let us go back to the Porto Rico of
long, long ago.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>EARLY TIMES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> find Columbus sailing into one of its
harbours after his second trip across the great
Atlantic Ocean. The trees and plants look
very beautiful to him. But he notices other
things; he sees rivers flowing down into the
sea, and the natives tell him of stores of gold
to be found in the beds of these streams. For
this reason he calls it "Puerto Rico," or the
"Rich Port," and so it has been called to this
day.</p>

<p>He and his men are full of interest in the
strange sights around them. In the waters
about Porto Rico are wonderful creatures they
have never seen before. Among these is the
manatee, which, rising up out of the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
looks at a distance somewhat like a human
being.</p>

<p>"It is a mermaid," cries Columbus, "but,
alas! it is not as beautiful as I expected." He
wrote of it in this way in the account of his
voyage.</p>

<p>In those days of long ago people had many
queer ideas. One of these notions was that
beings lived in the sea who had heads and
arms like men and women, but the lower parts
of their bodies were shaped like fishes. They
were, therefore, half human and half fish.
Their home was far down in cool groves at
the bottom of the sea. A diver once said he
had visited the very place. He found the
water perfectly clear, and lighted up by crystal
pyramids. There were gardens of beautiful
sea-weeds, furniture all made of precious
stones, and the strange beings dwelling there
wore ornaments and combs of shining gold.</p>

<p>They believed that these beings of the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
rose sometimes to the surface of the water.
There they would sing sweet songs as they
combed their long yellow hair. But they sang
only to make the sailors forget their own
homes and to lead them into harm.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Columbus was disappointed
when he discovered the manatee, and
believed he had at last seen the mermaids
of whom he had read so many stories. The
sea-cow is certainly not a beautiful creature.
It looks somewhat like a small whale; it has
a fat body, with small eyes and ears. It is
very timid, and probably swam off as fast as it
could when it found the vessels of Columbus
near. Of course, the great sailor did not get
a good view of it or he could not have believed
it to be the mermaid described in song
and story.</p>

<p>Not many years after Columbus discovered
Porto Rico, Ponce de Leon led a company of
Spaniards to its shores and settled there. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Indian chief of the country was very kind to
the strangers. He gave them provisions and
rich presents, and showed them the fruits and
vegetables which grew there. He shared his
treasures with them, and, most important of
all, he led them to a river where stores of gold
could be found in its bed.</p>

<p>Gold! It filled the Spaniards' hearts with
greed. This was what they had longed for;
now they could go back to their own country
with great fortunes.</p>

<p>How did they return the kindness of the
gentle, trusting natives? By treating them
like slaves! By making them do the hardest
labour, and then rewarding them with cruelties.</p>

<p>When they first came to the shores of the
island they had said to the Indians: "We are
immortal; we cannot die; we will live on for
ever."</p>

<p>But when the poor Indians had suffered for
a long time at their hands, and when many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
their kindred had died from the ill-treatment
of the Spaniards, they said:</p>

<p>"We will prove what these cruel strangers
have told us."</p>

<p>They seized a Spanish soldier and held his
head under water for two hours. Then they
carried his body to the shore of the river, and
sat down beside it for two whole days. But
it showed no signs of life. At the end of that
time they took the body to their chief, who
said:</p>

<p>"They have deceived us, for this man has
died, even as we would die."</p>

<p>You can easily imagine what followed.
There was war between the natives and the
strangers. But the poor Indians had little
chance. They had only bows and arrows,
rough spears of wood, and battle-axes of stone.
The Spaniards were armed with swords and
guns. Those Indians who were not killed
were made prisoners and set to work in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
gold mines and sugar fields, where they rapidly
died from their hard labour.</p>

<p>Years passed by. Ponce de Leon was
growing old. His hair was gray; his face
was wrinkled; the top of his head was bald.
He had many pains in his body and was often
ill.</p>

<p>Then he thought of the stories told by his
Indian slaves of a wonderful fountain not far
away. They declared that its waters were
always fresh and pure; not only this, but each
draught that a person swallowed would make
him younger and happier.</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the old man, "I wish I
might find this spring of living water, and rid
myself of stiff joints and rheumatism. I will
start out in search of it at once. If I can only
reach it, I shall become young and handsome
again, and shall never die."</p>

<p>This was the reason the conqueror of Porto
Rico sailed away to find the wonderful Fountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of Eternal Youth of which the Indians
had told him.</p>

<p>You probably know the story of the coming
of Ponce de Leon to Florida one beautiful
Easter Sunday, which in the Spanish language
is called <i>Pascua Florida</i>. So he called the
country Florida, saying:</p>

<p>"In this beautiful land must be the wondrous
fountain."</p>

<p>Soon afterward, while searching for it, he
was shot with a poisoned arrow, and died on
the voyage back to the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE CARIBS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Indians whom Ponce de Leon and his
followers treated so unkindly were gentle and
generous, as I have said. They were not
eager for war, like many of the tribes on the
continent, nor savage in their habits. They
wore short girdles of cotton cloth, raised crops
of corn and manioc, and built large canoes in
which they took quite long voyages. They
wrought the gold found in the streams into
ornaments.</p>

<p>This tribe of Indians was very numerous
at the time the Spaniards first came to the
West Indies, but now there is not a single
trace of them left. War with the Spaniards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
hard work for their masters in the mines and
fields,&mdash;these made the race die out rapidly.</p>

<p>It is sad to think that the Spaniards tortured
them also.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that the natives did not
care to share the Spaniards' heaven, but died
hating them with all their hearts?</p>

<p>Long before Ponce de Leon came to Porto
Rico, the poor Indians were attacked from
time to time by other enemies; but although
they suffered much, they were never conquered.
These enemies were the Caribs, who
seemed to love war better than anything else
in the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes the people would be strolling
along the shores of the island when they
would see something out on the ocean which
looked like a mass of floating palm leaves.
That did not frighten them, of course, and
they would go on with their sports.</p>

<p>When it was too late to give the alarm, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
discovered that the mass of palm leaves was
the covering of a boat-load of fierce warriors
who were all ready to attack them.</p>

<p>Or perhaps their foes would hide themselves
from sight in some other clever way
until they were all ready to spring out of their
boats and take the peaceful islanders by surprise.</p>

<p>You wonder, perhaps, where was the Caribs'
home. They told legends of a far-distant
land in the north, from which their own
people had come. They had fought their way
from Florida to South America, and feared no
one in the world. They believed that their
tribe had grown up out of the stones which
had been planted in the soil.</p>

<p>They belonged to the great Indian, or red,
race, as did the natives of Porto Rico, but
their customs and natures were very different.
They painted their faces to make themselves
look as fierce as they felt. They were trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to fight from the time when they were little
children. They loved to sail upon the ocean,
and guided their boats by studying the stars.</p>

<p>When the Spaniards had settled in Porto
Rico, the Caribs thought it would be an easy
thing to master them in fight, and trouble
them as they had troubled the poor natives.
But the white men were a match for them,
and, when they landed on the shores of the
island, the Spaniards entrapped them and
drove them over the side of a cliff down into
the water below. Not one Carib lived to tell
the story of that fearful day.</p>

<p>Time passed by and many workers were
needed, and as the natives became fewer the
Spaniards sent ships to the coast of Africa and
brought away the black people to be their
slaves. To-day the negroes are all free and
seem to be happy in their island home; but
most of them are very, very poor, as are the
greater part of the whites of Porto Rico. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
rule of Spain has kept them so; and it was
a glorious thing for these people when our
soldiers, under General Miles, marched in
triumph through the land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>A SEASIDE PICNIC.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> weeks have passed since Manuel
and Dolores went with their father to the
cock-fight. It is a beautiful June evening,
and the children are walking through the garden,
planning a picnic at the seashore for
to-morrow. Their mother comes out hastily
on the veranda, and calls:</p>

<p>"Manuel! Dolores! come in at once out
of the moonlight! You know well enough
that animals will never lie with the moon
shining upon them; they are too wise. Oh,
the evil I have seen that has come from the
moon! Don't you remember poor little
Sancho? He is feeble-minded because his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
careless nurse let him sleep in the moonlight
when he was a baby. Come quickly, my
darlings, to the shade of the veranda."</p>

<p>Manuel and Dolores are a little frightened,
and hurry toward the house, where they join the
family in Spanish songs before going to rest.</p>

<p>When Juana wakes them, early the next
morning, they hear the rain falling in torrents
outside. That will not prevent the picnic,
however, for they feel sure it will not last long.
It is the beginning of the spring rains, and
there are showers every day, but they seldom
continue more than an hour. But, oh, how
the rain falls when it does come! It seems as
though the heavens opened and all the water
in the sky fell at once.</p>

<p>By eight o'clock the shower is over, and
Teresa, her duenna, Manuel, and Dolores are
ready to start. The planter must be busy
to-day, and his wife does not care to go.</p>

<p>A low, comfortable carriage is drawn up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
front, the lunch is packed away under the
seats, and the coachman is told to start.
Ponce tries to follow, but Manuel orders him
back. They will drive at least ten miles, but
the roads are fine, it is down-hill all the way,
and the views are beautiful.</p>

<p>The party soon cross a bridge over a little
stream. There they see two women standing
nearly knee-deep in the water. They are
washing clothes and having a sociable chat
at the same time. Two large, flat stones
serve as scrubbing boards, and each one of
the women holds a club in her hands.</p>

<p>"What is that for?" one asks. To beat
the dirt out of the clothes! The garments
are spread on the stones, rubbed with some
native berries (instead of soap), then pounded
with the clubs. Not a delicate way to handle
fine linen, to be sure; but the women seem to
enjoy their work, and stop every few minutes
to sit on the banks and smoke their pipes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>When the party have nearly reached the
seashore, the road leads through thick woods.
Suddenly they hear a great scuttling among
the trees. The driver stops his horses, and
every one looks to see what is the matter.</p>

<p>It is nothing more nor less than an army of
land-crabs on their yearly journey from the
mountains to the sea. The children have
often found one of them in the garden or the
woods near the house, but such a number as
this, they have never seen or heard before.</p>

<p>These land-crabs can fight, and can frighten
the horses greatly, if they should choose to
take the road. So Pedro very wisely uses the
whip, and the party soon leave this queer army
behind them. The crabs make a dainty dish
when served with lime-juice and Cayenne pepper,
and Manuel and Dolores are very fond
of them served in this way.</p>

<p>A turn in the road brings the ocean in view.
Dolores claps her hands in delight, and cries:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i085.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="boy holding a large leaf, girl watching him" />
<div class="caption">"ONE IS QUITE LARGE, AND IS FORMED IN THE SHAPE OF A FAN"</div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, what a lovely time we will have! I
wonder who will find the most curiosities,
Manuel, you or I."</p>

<p>Even the sober-faced duenna looks pleased
as they drive out upon a smooth beach. How
beautiful the ocean looks to-day! It is such
a wonderful blue; much like the colour of the
sapphire, and not at all like the waters of
the northern seas.</p>

<p>The children take little baskets on their
arms and trot about barefooted to see what
they can find. It is a perfect paradise among
beaches. Their American brothers and sisters
would dance for joy at the sight of so many
kinds of beautiful shells. And the starfish!
Manuel finds one big fellow as much as ten
inches across. It is not flat like those seen
in the temperate zone, but at least six inches
through the middle of his horny body. The
little boy cannot get him off the rock to which
he has fastened, but Pedro comes, and even he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
has to use all his strength to pull him away.
A New York merchant is to visit the children's
father very soon, and Manuel wants
to send this starfish to his little son.</p>

<p>But there are other kinds of starfish here
that are pretty and delicate. Dolores finds a
dear little daisy-star only half an inch across,
with fringes on its sides, and, a moment after,
her sister picks up a fern-star.</p>

<p>What delights the children most of all are
the bits of coral washed up by the waves.
Some of the pieces are red, some black, and
others white. One is quite large, and is
formed in the shape of a fan, while another
spray looks like a mushroom.</p>

<p>After luncheon is over, Manuel says:</p>

<p>"Dolores, let's try to find some sea-anemones.
Do you see that rocky cliff at the
end of the beach? Perhaps if we go there
we can see some."</p>

<p>The children start off once more, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
are climbing up over the rock. They creep
along till they are able to look over its edge
as it juts out over the water.</p>

<p>What a wonderful sight meets their eyes!
It is the flower garden of the sea. Deep down
under the clear waters they see many things
living and growing that look for all the world
like roses and marigolds, pinks and buttercups.
What wonderful colours they have! Coral is
indeed beautiful, but it cannot compare with
the sea-anemones.</p>

<p>Manuel and his sister fairly hold their
breath with delight.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dolores, isn't it strange that those
lovely things are animals and not plants!
There they stay in one place for ever, yet
they are alive like the coral polyps. We
must get Teresa to come and see them, too.
She never saw them growing; I've heard her
say so."</p>

<p>Manuel whispers these words as though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
fears the anemones may hear him and hide
themselves from his sight. Dolores answers,
in her soft voice:</p>

<p>"Manuel, did you ever think about what
our teacher told us, that the bottom of the
ocean is like the land, with hills and valleys,
mountains and caves? Many kinds of creatures
live there, just as other kinds live on the
earth; but it seems to me that the coral polyps
and the sea-anemones are the strangest of
all."</p>

<p>When the children get back to the others,
they beg Alfonso to get a boat and row them
around to where the anemones are growing.
Perhaps they can reach some of them. But
he tells them that their father has forbidden
him to take them out on the water, for the
terrible blue shark dares to come quite close
to the shore, and, even in a row-boat, they
could not be sure of safety if a shark should
follow them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>He then tells them of adventures with
sharks by people living near their own home.</p>

<p>After these stories Manuel and Dolores are
quite willing to give up a row after anemones,
nor do they care to go in bathing, even close
to the shore.</p>

<p>The time comes all too soon to go home,
and all enjoy the ride in the cool evening air.
They have not travelled far before the moon
rises and sends its light down through the
tree-tops.</p>

<p>Dolores happens to be looking out of the
carriage, when she sees an ugly-looking animal
peering out from behind a bush. It is an
iguana, with jaws and mouth like an alligator.
He looks fierce enough to devour any one,
but Alfonso assures the party that he is really
a very timid creature, and will not fight unless
he is cornered and cannot get away. He likes
to live quietly by himself in the trees and
bushes, and no doubt is afraid of the horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>After awhile the children grow sleepy and
doze in each other's arms till home is reached.
Their father and mother are watching, and the
dinner has been kept waiting until they should
arrive.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>THE WONDERFUL CAVE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> have so much to tell, it seems as
though they had been gone a week. Their
mother is most interested in hearing about the
anemones, while their father wishes he could
have been with them when they saw the land-crabs.</p>

<p>"It makes me think," says he, "of a wonderful
trip I made when I was quite a young
man. I met land-crabs that day in a much
stranger place than you ever saw them, Manuel.
Did I ever tell you children about my
visit to the 'Great Caves'?"</p>

<p>Manuel and Dolores draw close to their
father's side and exclaim together:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, no, papa. Oh, do tell us, please. I
never even heard of them."</p>

<p>The planter smiles and answers: "It is not
strange, my dears, for there are people living
within a much shorter distance of these
caves who have never heard of them, as well
as yourselves. It is, indeed, odd; but you
will yet see the day when travellers from distant
lands will visit our island for the sake of
seeing the wonderful things hidden away in
those very caverns.</p>

<p>"When I was younger, I was always looking
for adventures. My father was a rich
man, and I was allowed to do very much as I
liked. So when some friends of mine asked
me to join them in a trip to the caves, I
was much pleased. They told me the ride
would be tiresome and perhaps dangerous,
but I liked the idea far better for that very
reason.</p>

<p>"We started out early one morning. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
guides went with us. They were men who
had been in the caves many times. They
knew the best way to reach them. We carried
coils of rope and a roll of pitch lights, as well
as a good luncheon.</p>

<p>"If we could have gone straight up the side
of the mountain, it would have been a short
trip; but the trail led up and down, in and
out. Now we had to climb a narrow ridge,
and then descend again into a valley. One of
these ridges was so steep that I had to hold on
to the pommel of the saddle with all my might.
I shut my eyes at the same time. I feared I
would grow dizzy and slip from the back of
the horse down the side of the precipice.</p>

<p>"But this was for only a short distance.
Most of the road was very beautiful and lined
with fruit-trees. Sometimes we could have
picked great ripe oranges without dismounting;
in many a narrow pass the clusters of
bananas hung down so near us we had to bend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
our heads to keep from being knocked from
the saddles.</p>

<p>"At last we had climbed so high we found
ourselves with mountain tops on every side.
Far below lay an immense coffee plantation.
We could see the great drying-pans near the
buildings. Only a short distance ahead of us
was a white cliff of limestone. Here lay the
caves we had come to visit.</p>

<p>"We tied our horses to some trees, and
crept, hand and foot, up through a narrow
gorge. Its sides were walls of rock, and its
roof was made of vines, ferns, and overhanging
fruit-trees. How sweet and cool the air seemed!</p>

<p>"Yes, straight in front of us we could just
see two great black holes. These were the
doorways of the caves. And now the guides
handed each one of us a lighted torch. The
burning gum made a sweet incense as it sputtered.
It gave the only light we should have
for many hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"The guides slowly led the way into the
dark cavern ahead. The floor was wet and
muddy, and we had to take care not to slip.</p>

<p>"Ugh! there were numbers of great black
spiders here. Their bite might be poisonous,
and we took care not to lay our hands against
the walls where they travelled up and down.
The place was damp and slippery. There
was certainly nothing beautiful to be seen yet.</p>

<p>"Hark! There was a rustling sound over
our heads. It grew louder and louder, until
we could not hear each other's voices. As we
looked up into the darkness, we could see we
had startled an army of bats. There were
thousands of them. Yes, surely, many thousands.
You wouldn't have enjoyed their flying
around you one bit, Manuel, good little
huntsman even as you are. And as for you,
my precious Dolores, I fear you would have
screamed and begged to be taken home.</p>

<p>"Over our heads we could hear the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of running water all the time. We kept
bravely on. It began to grow lighter, and we
could see several openings in front of us.
Choosing one of these, we crept through a
narrow passage and found ourselves at once in
a vast hall. It was like Aladdin's palace,
which, you remember, was brilliant with beautiful
gems.</p>

<p>"I looked up to the high roof and saw
hundreds of sparkling white pendants. Some
of them were quite small, but others reached
down so far that I could touch them. They
shone like the finest marble. They were
made by the water trickling through the roof
and leaving particles of lime as it slowly made
its way downward. Such pendants are called
stalactites. Some of them were tinted a beautiful
blue or green. This was because the
water had passed through some mineral substance
of those colours.</p>

<p>"And the walls of that hall! Sparkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
white columns reached from the floor to the
very dome. They were fluted and worked in
the most delicate patterns. I can never forget
that wonderful picture.</p>

<p>"But what ugly creatures made their home
in this wonderful palace of Mother Nature?
They were land-crabs, to be sure, that tried to
get out of our way as fast as their clumsy feet
would permit. It was your story of the crabs,
Manuel, that made me think of that day's
tramp.</p>

<p>"You can hardly believe it, children, but
we passed from one such hall to another until
we had travelled at least a mile underground.
Here and there were dark holes leading farther
down yet. We could look over the edge
sometimes and see other great hallways directly
under where we were. The guides
said:</p>

<p>"'No, no, you must not try to reach them.
You may never get back.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I insisted on going into one, at least.
A stout rope was fastened about my waist;
two men held it tightly, and gradually let
me go. Down I went, down, down, down.
Would I never reach the bottom? I was
growing a little scared, when I found myself
on the floor of another great hall, much like
the one above it. I groped about and relighted
my torch, which had gone out as I was
lowered through the damp air.</p>

<p>"I found myself beside a stream of running
water. It was flowing right by the doorway
into the cave. I had heard there was just
such an entrance as this,&mdash;that down on the
side of the mountain a person could get into
the cavern by first passing through the water.</p>

<p>"I had read a legend of this very place. It
was about a young girl who had hidden herself
from her enemies by swimming into the
cave through the secret entrance below the
surface of the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"By this time my friends were getting worried
about me. I felt a gentle pull at the
rope and I heard them calling. Their voices
seemed strange and far away. And now I was
slowly lifted upward to find myself in the
midst of my friends.</p>

<p>"It was time to turn again toward the daylight.
We said good-bye to the cave and its
city of palaces. In another hour we were
again in open air, looking at mountain tops.
We asked ourselves if the day's wonderful
sights really had been a dream or not."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>THE HURRICANE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Weeks</span> pass by; it is August, and the midst
of the rainy season. This is the time to be
ready for hurricanes. No one feels safe, for
at any moment he may be taken by surprise,
and his home, with its massive stone walls,
may be dashed to the ground.</p>

<p>Such a thing never yet has happened to
Manuel's family, but that does not keep fear
away. Does not Manuel remember the story
of Josephine, afterward the beautiful wife of
Napoleon? She spent her young days on an
island not far from Porto Rico. In a few
hours the plantation on which she lived was
wrecked by a hurricane and hardly a trace of
her home was left. It is fearful to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
what she and her family suffered, but Manuel
and Dolores cannot keep the story out of
their minds when the midsummer storms arrive.</p>

<p>They are kept in terror at least three
months of the year, for the hurricane season
begins the latter part of July, and the great
winds may come at any moment from that
time on to the end of October.</p>

<p>If the children should visit the shore now,
they would find all the boats drawn up high
and dry in sheltered nooks. The fishermen
are afraid to venture out to any distance for
fear of sudden danger.</p>

<p>This very morning Manuel's father looked
at the barometer before he left the house, for
that is the first thing to tell him a storm is
approaching. Then he directed Alfonso to
see if the iron bars were in good order for
fastening the casements; everything must be
in readiness for a sudden departure.</p>

<p>After his ride around the plantation, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
stopped at the hill-cave, or hurricane house,
and directed one of the workmen to leave the
door open for awhile, to air it.</p>

<p>This cave was dug out of the side of a hill
near the house when Manuel and Dolores were
still babies. It is lined with a thick wall of
stones; it has no windows or other opening
except a low, narrow doorway. At the first
sign of a hurricane, the whole family flee to
this cave, and stay there till the storm is over.</p>

<p>Look! the sky is overcast. And now it
has become the colour of lead. How sultry
it is! Not a leaf moves, except when a sudden
gust of wind takes it by surprise. The barometer
is falling rapidly. See the lightning
flashing over the sky, with no sound of thunder
to follow it.</p>

<p>Dolores begins to tremble and cry. Even
her mother grows pale, and often crosses herself
in silent prayer. The planter moves quickly
around, giving orders to the overseer about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
workmen and the cattle. Stout-hearted little
Manuel is very busy. He must not let
Dolores think he is afraid. No, not for anything!
He helps Alfonso carry the food and
cushions out to the hurricane house, while the
doors and shutters of the mansion are being
locked and barred.</p>

<p>There is no time to be lost. A man has
just ridden by, telling of the strange appearance
of the ocean.</p>

<p>"It was perfectly still," he said, "but far
out on the water long, quiet, sweeping waves
rolled in toward the shore, then broke suddenly
at a fearful height close to land."</p>

<p>And now all hasten out to the cave. There
is no laughing; every one is still and sober.
The door is shut and made fast. It is as dark
as a tomb within. The air is heavy. But no
one thinks of fretting; all are too busy listening
to the howling of the wind and the noise
of falling trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The planter steadily watches the barometer
by the dim light of a lantern. Manuel and
Dolores cling to their mother, one on each
side. Teresa strives to appear calm, and her
duenna is the only one who tries to talk.</p>

<p>Hours upon hours pass by. Ah! what
does that trembling of the ground mean? It
makes one feel dizzy and strange. It is the
shock of a slight earthquake. It is over now,
and at the same time it becomes quiet outside.
Papa once more looks at the barometer, and
says it is rising, and it will soon be safe to
venture out.</p>

<p>When the door is opened, and they feel the
fresh air on their faces once more, they look
out on the darkness of night. But the stars
are shining with their usual brightness, and the
air is filled with peace and quiet.</p>

<p>Was it all a dream? Oh, no! for broken
trees and branches bar the pathway to the
house, while pools of water are everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
about. The dear old home is safe except that
a part of the veranda has been torn away.</p>

<p>The sunlight next morning shows that many
of the roofs at the quarters have been blown
off, while much damage was done to the coffee-trees.
No human being or animal on the place
has been injured, and all give thanks that the
hurricane has passed.</p>

<p>"Let us hope," says Manuel's father, "we
shall not see another such storm this year.
One bad storm is quite enough for a season,
I am sure."</p>

<p>The time of danger passes by, and although
there are many severe storms, not one of them
is so bad that the family are obliged to hide
themselves in the hill-cave. The autumn rains
are very heavy, and Manuel and Dolores spend
much time in the house or on the verandas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>THE NEW BABY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">November</span> comes, and early one morning
Juana enters the children's rooms very much
excited. She wakes them with the news that
a little sister was born to them last night.</p>

<p>"A baby! a dear, darling little baby in the
house!" cries Dolores. "Oh! I have begged
mother for one so often! Now we shall always
have something to amuse us. Manuel,
aren't you glad?"</p>

<p>The children do not care for chocolate and
rolls in bed this morning; that is certain.
They must see the precious baby as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>It is such a dear little mite. It fills all
hearts with joy. But it must be christened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
without delay. Who shall be godfather?
The planter and his wife consider very carefully.
At last they decide to ask a great friend
of theirs, who is the owner of a sugar plantation
not far from them. He is very wealthy,
and will no doubt celebrate the christening in
grand style.</p>

<p>In the next place, what shall be the baby's
name? Of course, she must be called "Maria"
to begin with. Every girl-baby is named
Maria, and if there are no girls in the family,
the boy receives that name as his first. I suppose
the name is in honour of Mary, the
mother of Jesus.</p>

<p>But what others must be added? Manuel
suggests Christina, while Dolores begs that her
baby sister be called Lucia. At length it is
decided that this tiny tot shall bear the dignified
name of Maria Francesca Christina Lucia,
and every one is pleased.</p>

<p>When the baby is just one week old, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
christening takes place. Several beautiful carriages
drive up to the house, and the friends
and relatives take their places inside. The
godfather is a fine-looking gentleman with
piercing black eyes and black moustache. He
has made Manuel and Dolores happy by presenting
each of them with a gold piece strung
on a ribbon. He has also given each one of
the house servants a piece of silver.</p>

<p>The children are dressed in white and look
very pretty. The baby wears a beautiful robe,
embroidered by the nuns. As she lies sleeping
in her nurse's arms, she does not dream
that this celebration is all in her honour.</p>

<p>The christening party drives away to the
church, while the mother lies in her chamber,
quietly resting. She is not well enough to go
with them.</p>

<p>After the service is over, the godfather invites
the guests to attend a dinner party in
honour of his little godchild, at his own home;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
but the baby must now go back to her loving
mother. She could scarcely appreciate the
feast, and is much safer at home. So the
nurse is driven off in one of the carriages with
her precious charge, while the rest of the party
go to the godfather's beautiful house.</p>

<p>Such a feast as is spread before them! Such
a display of silver and china! What a richly
embroidered table cover! Course after course
is served.</p>

<p>First there is a rich soup, followed by fried
chicken and rice coloured with tomato; there
are salads, stews of game, fruits hot and cold,
a dainty dessert, cheese and coffee.</p>

<p>Soon after the feast is over, the children return
home, for their dear mother must not get
lonesome.</p>

<p>The baby grows rapidly, and when she is
two months old the planter proposes to take
the whole family to San Juan, the capital of
the island. Teresa is perhaps more joyful than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
any one else, for now she will have a chance to
wear some lovely new dresses at the evening
parties she will attend there.</p>

<p>Manuel and Dolores are most pleased because
they are to travel in a sailing vessel.
They will, at last, have a chance to see live
sharks as well as other strange creatures of the
sea, of which they have heard.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>THE CITY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a delightful trip. The weather is just
cool enough for comfort, and no one is seasick.
The children are never tired of sitting
on deck and watching the views, changing hour
by hour.</p>

<p>They are never out of sight of land, but
sail along the shores of their loved island.
Here is a little village of palm-thatched huts,
there a grove of breadfruit or cocoanut trees;
again one meets another sailing vessel with all
its men busy shark-fishing. The skin of the
ugly monster is valuable, as well as its fins and
tail, which are prized as food by many of the
people of Porto Rico.</p>

<p>Looking down beneath the clear blue waters
Dolores descries the rainbow fish and claps her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
hands at its beauty. It is so called because
of its many beautiful colours.</p>

<p>And see! Here is a shoal of flying-fish
darting over the waters. They do not really
fly, as some people think, but dart up out of
the water, with their long fins spread in such
a way that they are carried through the air for
quite a distance.</p>

<p>Deep down in the water the children see
a beautiful object. It is moving rapidly, and
its back shines like burnished gold, then
changes in the sunlight into many shades and
tints of colour.</p>

<p>"Papa, do please come quickly, and tell me
what this is," calls Manuel.</p>

<p>"That is a dolphin, my dear, one of the
most beautiful of all creatures living in the
sea," says his father, as he looks over the
ship's side. "But he is always hungry, and
if he sees those flying-fish ahead of him it will
be a sad day for them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<p>At this very moment the dolphin seems to
get a view of his favourite prey. He darts
to the surface of the water and leaps forward
at the flying-fish with the speed of a bullet;
at least it seems so to the watching children,
who pity the little fellows with all their hearts.
When they discover their foe it is too late for
them to escape, for, although they flee with
all their might, now in one direction, then in
another, the dolphin gains upon them and
snaps them up one by one in his great jaws.
In their fright many of them throw themselves
clear out of the water with their fins spread,
and are carried many feet on the air. It is
this that gives them the appearance of flying.</p>

<p>The voyage seems only too short to Manuel
and Dolores. When they arrive at San
Juan there are so many new things to see that
the days pass only too quickly. They have
never been in the city before.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i115.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="village street" />
<div class="caption">A STREET IN SAN JUAN</div>
</div>

<p>The narrow streets, with the still narrower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sidewalks, seem odd indeed to these children
used to plantation life. Sometimes they cannot
even walk side by side without one being
pushed into the street. And the houses,
although many of them are built of stone like
their own, are so close together that Manuel
says to his sister:</p>

<p>"I wonder how people can like being so
crowded together. I should think they would
feel choked."</p>

<p>The friends whom they visit live on the
upper floor of their house. Although they
are quite wealthy, they let the lower floor to
a poor, dirty, and ignorant family with many
children. Such an arrangement is often made
in San Juan; but the two families do not
mingle at all, although living in the same
house.</p>

<p>Balconies jut out from the upper story, and
Manuel and Dolores like to sit here and
watch the passers-by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>It is so odd to see the milkman ride up to
the house astride of his donkey, with his milk
cans jostling against each other between his
legs. Sometimes a cow is led through the
streets, and her owner stops at neighbouring
doorways to draw the milk as the people wish.
Dolores thinks the milk must be much nicer
when obtained in this way.</p>

<p>"But look, now, Manuel," she says, "at
that poor mule! He is almost smothered
under an immense bundle of fodder; and, as
though that were not enough for the poor
beastie, his master is riding on top of the load."</p>

<p>Sometimes the children rise as early as five
o'clock in the morning. They like to go to
the market held in a public square of the city.
They see people of all shades of colour selling
their goods.</p>

<p>There is the baker with his bags of freshly
baked bread and oddly twisted rolls; there is
the poultry man with wicker cages full of live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
fowls hanging to the sides of his half-starved
donkey; there, too, is the butcher with sides
of beef hanging by hooks from his horse's
harness; while crowded together are those who
have brought their fruits and vegetables afoot
many a long mile in early morning.</p>

<p>There are great piles of yellow oranges; plantains,
green, brown, and yellow; pineapples,
melons, onions, guavas, and lemons; while
behind them sit their owners, who laugh and
joke and make love, and at the same time are
busy shouting their wares and making bargains.</p>

<p>Oh, but one must not forget the game-cocks
fastened to stakes here and there in the midst
of the busy crowd. Many a trade is made,
many a bet laid on these ugly, skinny, but
greatly admired cocks as they pull at their
stakes.</p>

<p>Later in the day no sign of this busy scene
is left in the public square. One notices for
the first time that there is a band stand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
when the evening comes, Manuel's father and
mother are driven with their hosts to this
square. Many other carriages, filled with
richly dressed ladies and gentlemen, also arrive
and take their places at one side of the band
stand. Here they sit laughing and chatting
or listening to the music; the ladies' black
eyes sparkle as a favourite tune is played, and
they keep time by gentle taps of their fans.</p>

<p>Many of these fans are very beautiful.
Manuel's mother has one made of the feathers
of humming-birds. It is brilliant, even in the
soft light of evening, and the dear lady herself
looks very charming with a lace mantilla drawn
over her head, its point reaching down over
the forehead almost to her nose. To be sure,
her cheeks are heavily powdered, but that is
the fashion of all the ladies in her land, and so
it seems quite natural.</p>

<p>The rest of the square is filled with the crowd
of poorer people who cannot afford to ride.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
They walk slowly about, and seem to enjoy the
music and each other's company as much as
those who sit in the carriages.</p>

<p>There are many street processions in San
Juan, and the children are on the lookout not
to miss them. These processions are in honour
of some saint. Dolores is out on the balcony
one morning when she hears music. It
is the voices of children singing.</p>

<p>"O Manuel, Teresa, mamma, do come and
see the pretty sight," she calls, as a procession
draws near.</p>

<p>People dressed in the costumes of different
lands come marching by; then follows a cart,
decked gaily with flowers, and in it stands a
little girl dressed to represent the virgin mother
of Jesus. There is a band of music playing
sacred airs.</p>

<p>The children take their hats and follow the
procession to the public square, where the
little girl in the flower-decked carriage recites a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
poem written in honour of the day. All business
stops in the stores near by. All vehicles
give way to the procession, and the passers-by
stand still to admire and listen.</p>

<p>It seems strange to the children to see the
red, white, and blue of the American flag floating
over the city, instead of the colours of
Spain&mdash;the red and yellow they were formerly
taught to love.</p>

<p>"But this new flag means friendship, you
know, Dolores," says her brother. "The
poor will not be taxed so much as they used
to be, and the good Americans will not allow
any other people to harm us. At least father
says so, and he is very wise. Dolores, he has
promised to take us sometime to that wonderful
city, New York, where we shall see so
much we have never even dreamed of. I hope
the time will come soon, for I want to get acquainted
with my American cousins in their
own land, our own land, now."</p>
